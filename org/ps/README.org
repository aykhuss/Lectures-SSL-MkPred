* Introduction
We will investigate the emission probability of gluons off quarks and gluons and use that to implement a *very* simplified parton shower (only final state, primary branching, leading double-log, only virtuality $q^2$ and not proper kinematics, ...).

* Emission probability and the Sudakov form factor
In the leading double-log approximation (soft /and/ collinear emission), we have seen in the lecture that the emission probability is given as
\begin{align}
  \mathrm{d}\omega_{X\to X+g}
  &=
  2 \, \frac{\alpha_s}{\pi}\; C_X \; \frac{\mathrm{d}E}{E} \; \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\theta}
  \,,
\end{align}
where $E$ denotes the energy of the emitted gluon and $\theta$ the angle w.r.t. the parent particle.
We denote the emitting particle by "$X$" and $C_X$ is the associated colour factor.
For quarks, $C_X=C_F=\tfrac{4}{3}$ and for gluons $C_X=C_A=3$.

For any parton shower, we first need to fix the evolution variable w.r.t. which we want to generate emissions.
To this end, we choose the virtuality $q^2$ associated with the emission for which we find
\begin{align}
  d\mathcal{P}
  &=
  \frac{\alpha_s}{\pi}\; C_X \; \frac{\mathrm{d}q^2}{q^2} \; \ln\biggl(\frac{q^2}{Q_0^2}\biggr)
  \xrightarrow{\int\mathrm{d}q^2}
  \frac{\alpha_s C_X}{2\pi} \, \ln^2\biggl(\frac{q^2}{Q_0^2}\biggr)
\end{align}
where $Q_0$ denotes a cutoff below which emissions are considered unresolved.
Note that this fixed-order result comes with a serious problem: For one $\alpha_s$, we get two powers of a potentially large logarithm (the so-called "double logarithms" that appear frequently in higher-order calculations), a pattern that will continue to higher orders.
For some representative values ($\alpha_s \sim 0.1$, $Q_0 \sim \Lambda_\mathrm{QCD} \sim 0.2\,\mathrm{GeV}$, $q\sim 100\,\mathrm{GeV}$), we quickly realize that the large logarithm compensates the small value of the coupling, giving rise to a non-converging expansion.
In such situations, where we are sensitive to large logarithms, we need to re-arrange the perturbative expansion in such a way to "re-sum" these large logarithms to all orders.

To accomplish this, we define the so-called Sudakov form factor $\Delta(Q^2,q^2)$, which is the probability for /no resolved emissions/ to happen between the evolution $Q^2 \to q^2$.
It satisfies a differential equation reminiscent of radiative decay with a simple solution
\begin{align}
  \frac{\mathrm{d}\Delta(Q^2,q^2)}{\mathrm{d}q^2}
  &=
  \Delta(Q^2,q^2) \; \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathcal{P}}{\mathrm{d}q^2}
  \,,\nonumber\\
  \Delta(Q^2)
  &\equiv \Delta(Q^2,Q_0^2)
  =
  \exp\biggl\{-\frac{\alpha_s C_X}{2\pi} \, \ln^2\biggl(\frac{q^2}{Q_0^2}\biggr) \biggr\}
  \,,
\end{align}
which now has the large logarithm in the exponent.
This solution therefore accomplishes exactly what we wanted: sum up the problematic logarithms to all orders, and in doing so, tame the otherwise divergent behaviour ($Q_0\to0$).
It turns out that we can use the Sudakov form factor to sample successive emissions (it's a Markovian process), which we discuss in the next section.

* Implementation

With the Sudakov form factor at hand, we can easily iterate the sampling of emissions using the following steps:
1. set $Q = Q_\mathrm{start}$
2. draw a uniform random number $r$ in the range $[0,\,1]$
3. if $r<\Delta(Q^2)$, no resolvable emission can be generated ($<Q_0$):
   Terminate loop.
4. solve $r = \Delta(Q^2) / \Delta(Q_\mathrm{new}^2)$ for $Q_\mathrm{new}$, which is the new emission scale.
5. "generate" the emission at $Q_\mathrm{new}$, set $Q = Q_\mathrm{new}$ and go back to step 2.

#+INCLUDE: "main.py" src python

Let's use the implementation to generate some "events"
#+begin_src shell :results silent
python main.py 100 g 0.118 100000 > data_g.dat
python main.py 100 q 0.118 100000 > data_q.dat
#+end_src

We can see that the all-order description damps the divergent behaviour of a pure fixed-order prediction for $Q\to0$.
Given $C_A > C_F$, we also see how a gluon generates more emissions than quarks.
This property can be exploited to try and discriminate between "quark jets" and "gluon jets".

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
- To increase the amount of emissions, try out setting the strong coupling to $\alpha_s=0.5$.
  How does the picture change?
