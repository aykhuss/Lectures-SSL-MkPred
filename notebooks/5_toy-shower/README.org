* Introduction
We will investigate the gluon-emission probability off quarks and gluons and use that to implement a *very* simplified parton shower (single final-state leg, only primary branching, leading double-log, only $k_T$ and not proper kinematics, ...).

* Emission probability and the Sudakov form factor
In the leading double-log approximation (soft /and/ collinear emission), we have seen in the lecture that the emission probability is given as
\begin{align}
  \mathrm{d}\omega_{X\to X+g}
  &=
  \frac{2\alpha_s C_X}{\pi} \; \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\theta} \; \frac{\mathrm{d}E}{E}
  \,,
\end{align}
where $E$ denotes the energy of the emitted gluon and $\theta$ the angle w.r.t. the parent particle.
We denote the emitting particle by "$X$" and $C_X$ is the associated colour factor.
For quarks, $C_X=C_F=\tfrac{4}{3}$ and for gluons $C_X=C_A=3$.

For any parton shower, we need to choose an evolution variable w.r.t. which we want to generate ordered emissions (angle $\theta$, transverse momentum $k_T$, virtuality $q^2$, ...).
We will perform a slight change of variables, $k_T \propto E \theta$ (transverse momentum w.r.t. the parent parton) and $z \propto E$ (energy fraction of the emitted gluon) and integrate out the momentum fraction with the $k_T$ constraint to obtain the emission probability
\begin{align}
  \mathrm{d}\mathcal{P}_\text{emit}
  &=
  \frac{2\alpha_s C_X}{\pi} \; \frac{\mathrm{d}k_T}{k_T} \int_{k_T/k_T^\mathrm{max}}^1 \frac{\mathrm{d}z}{z}
  =
  \frac{2\alpha_s C_X}{\pi} \; \frac{\mathrm{d}k_T}{k_T} \ln\biggl(\frac{k_T^\mathrm{max}}{k_T}\biggr)
  \,,
\end{align}
where $k_T^\mathrm{max}$ denotes the upper bound on the transverse momentum that the emission can carry and is of the order of the hard scale.

We will further integrate over $k_T$ with a lower cut-off $k_T^\mathrm{cut}$, below which we consider the emission to be unresolved, and get for the probability of a single resolved emission
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{P}_\text{emit}(k_T>k_T^\mathrm{cut})
  &=
  \frac{\alpha_s C_X}{\pi} \; \ln^2\biggl(\frac{k_T^\mathrm{max}}{k_T^\mathrm{cut}}\biggr)
  \,.
\end{align}
Note that this fixed-order result comes with a serious problem: For a power of $\alpha_s$, we get two powers of a potentially large logarithm (the so-called "double logarithms" that appear frequently in higher-order calculations), a pattern that will continue to higher orders.
For some representative values ($\alpha_s \sim 0.1$, $k_T^\mathrm{cut} \sim \Lambda_\mathrm{QCD} \sim 0.2\,\mathrm{GeV}$, $k_T^\mathrm{max} \sim 100\,\mathrm{GeV}$), we quickly realize that the large logarithm compensates the small value of the coupling, giving rise to a non-converging expansion.
In such situations, where we are sensitive to large logarithms, we need to re-arrange the perturbative expansion in such a way to "re-sum" these large logarithms to all orders.

To accomplish this, we define the so-called Sudakov form factor $\Delta(t,t')$, which is the probability for /no resolved emissions/ to happen between the evolution $t \to t'$, where we introduced an "evolution time" $t\equiv\ln(k_T^\mathrm{max}/k_T)$.
The Sudakov form factor is /multiplicative/, i.e. obeys $\Delta(t,t'') = \Delta(t,t') \Delta(t',t'')$, and satisfies a differential equation reminiscent of that of radiative decay ($\mathcal{P_\text{no-emit}} = 1-\mathcal{P_\text{emit}}$):
#+name: eq:Dsud
\begin{align}
  \frac{\mathrm{d}\Delta(t_0,t)}{\mathrm{d}t}
  &=
  \Delta(t,t') \; \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathcal{P_\text{no-emit}}}{\mathrm{d}t'}
  =
  - \Delta(t,t') \; \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathcal{P_\text{emit}}}{\mathrm{d}t'}
  \,,
\end{align}
which has a simple solution
#+name: eq:sud
\begin{align}
  \Delta(t,t')
  &=
  \Delta(t') / \Delta(t)
  \,,\nonumber\\
  \Delta(t)
  &\equiv \Delta(0,t)
  =
  \exp\biggl\{-\frac{\alpha_s C_X}{2\pi} \, t^2 \biggr\}
  =
  \exp\biggl\{-\frac{\alpha_s C_X}{2\pi} \, \ln^2\biggl(\frac{k_T^\mathrm{max}}{k_T}\biggr) \biggr\}
  \,,
\end{align}
which now has the large logarithm in the exponent.
This solution therefore accomplishes exactly what we wanted: sum up the problematic logarithms to all orders, and in doing so, tame the otherwise divergent behaviour ($k_T\to0$).
It turns out that we can use the Sudakov form factor to sample successive emissions (it is a Markovian process), which we discuss in the next section together with a simple implementation.

* Implementation

** Interlude: Sampling
Assume we have a uniform random number generator at our disposal sampling values in the range $r\in[0,1]$.
We wish to generate samples $x_i$ drawn from a probability distribution $p(x)$.
In the so-called /inversion method/, we use the fact that the /cumulant/ distribution, $P(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x\mathrm{d}x' p(x')$, is a strictly monotonic function with values in $P(x)\in[0,1]$ (it is a probability).
We can thus obtain a sample $x_i$ by drawing $r_i$ uniformly from $[0,1]$ and then /inverting/ the relation $r_i = P(x_i)$ for x_i.
The sample $x_i$ generated this way, follows the probability distribution $p(x)$.

Often times, the cumulant of the distribution is not easy to invert.
In such cases, one can also use the /rejection method/ (or "hit-and-miss") by finding a simpler distribution $\tilde{p}(x)$ that bounds $p(x)$ from above (in the simplest case the bound is just a constant).
If we can draw samples from $\tilde{p}(x)$, all we need to do is to correct for the difference with respect to $p(x)$.
This can be accomplished by drawing another uniform random number $s_i\in[0,1]$ and only accepting the point $\tilde{x}_i$ generated with $\tilde{p}(x)$ with the probability $p(\tilde{x}_i)/\tilde{p}(\tilde{x}_i)$.


** Our Toy Shower
With the Sudakov form factor in Eq. eqref:eq:sud at hand, we can easily iterate the sampling of emissions using the /inversion method/ described above given that the cumulant that corresponds to the probability for the /next emission/ is precisely the Sudakov.
The steps of the shower are:
1. set $k_T = k_T^\mathrm{max}$
2. draw a uniform random number $r$ in the range $[0,\,1]$
3. solve $r = \Delta(k_T, k_T')$ for $k_T'$, which is the new emission scale.
4. if $k_T'<k_T^\mathrm{cut}$, no resolvable emission can be generated:
   Terminate loop.
5. "generate" the emission at $k_T'$, set $k_T = k_T'$ and go back to step 2.
The shower cut-off $k_T^\mathrm{cut}$ is typically set to $\mathcal{1\,\mathrm{GeV}}$ and represents the scale at which the perturbative shower description breaks down and the generated emissions are handed over to the hadronization model to simulate the non-perturbative hadronization stage of the simulation.

We can see that the all-order description damps the divergent behaviour of a pure fixed-order prediction for $k_T\to0$.
We show separately the first emission alone, which can be compared to the analytic expression in Eq. eqref:eq:Dsud given by the solid line and is in excellent agreement with the shower.
In addition, we include a dotted line that corresponds to the fixed-order expression that is logarithmically divergent.
Given $C_A > C_F$, we also see how a gluon generates more emissions than quarks.
This property can be exploited to try and discriminate between "quark jets" and "gluon jets".
