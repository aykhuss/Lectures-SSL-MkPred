This folder collects the notebooks that were used during the lectures.
I use [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] for the computational notebooks collected in the =org= folder.
1. $\mathrm{e}^+\mathrm{e}^- \to \mu^+ \mu^-$:
  Compute various observables and illustrate their sensitivity to fundamental Standard Model parameters.
2. Parton Distribution Functions:
  Use LHAPDF to play with PDFs and numerically check sumrules.
3. to be filled
