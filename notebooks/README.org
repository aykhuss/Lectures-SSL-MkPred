This folder collects the notebooks that were used during the lectures.
I use [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] for the computational notebooks collected in the =org= folder.
1. $\mathrm{e}^+\mathrm{e}^- \to \mu^+ \mu^-$:
  Compute various observables and illustrate their sensitivity to fundamental Standard Model parameters.
2. Parton Distribution Functions:
  Use LHAPDF to play with PDFs and numerically check sum rules.
3. The Drell-Yan process
  Differential predictions for the simplest hadron-collider process
4. Feynman Diagrams
  Use a Feynman diagram generator to have a look at how their number scale with multiplicity.
5. Parton showers
  A toy implementation to illustrate the basic concepts of a parton shower
